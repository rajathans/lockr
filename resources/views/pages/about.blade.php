	<h5>In November 2014 the Maharashtra government launched a new AadharÂ­-linked facility. 
	Maharashtra government developed an online repository for important documents like 
	certificates, degrees, etc which are frequently required to apply for any job and other 
	services. The "Maha Digital Locker" will end to hassle of physically carrying important 
	documents like education and property certificates. </h5>
	<h5> Lockr is a similar project aimed specifically towards the student community. It will provide 
	students with a unique id based on their college enrollment number using which they can 
	access and carry all the important documents from anywhere. The security features of E 
	locker will prevent its misuse, all documents of user will be protected by a password that 
	the user can choose. The password is stored in the database after encryption using hashing 
	and is safe. </h5>
	<h5>The project is currently supposed to be operational in a smaller environment like a
	school or college or a single organizational office.
	Basic features of the web application are as follows:<br>
	<b>1. Uploading scanned copies of their documents.<br>
	2. Downloading the uploaded documents.<br>
	3. Using the uploaded documents to fill out official forms.<br>
	4. Editing their personal profile information.</b>
	</h5>
	<h5>Applying for any exam and require your mark sheets or certificates? 
	Imagine being able to access all papers required for the service through a college 
	enrollment number linked online repository which will store all important certificates like 
	those related to birth, passport and educational qualifications.
	This web application aims to do just that to help the students and end the hassle of
	carrying all documents physically. </h5>
